THIS CLASS USED: Python

This Machine Learning course went over different machine learning techniques and had us implement them. 

The professor provided most of the code, but we implemented specific machine learning techniques using numpy and matplotlib.

After implementing many ML techniques and developing a solid understanding of machine learning, we started to use the sklearn library.

For project two, I used KNN and Neural Networks (MLPCLASSIFIER) from sklearn to analyze human activity while using a smartphone. I then created a report on my findings and code.
Since the data was high dimensional, I used PCA to reduce the dimensions in order to present my data.
