Assuming the linked list class that adds and removes elements from the front and back of the list are complete and functional,

1) implement a stack class by inheriting the linked list class (see class interface for the template version attached attached, write a string version as well)

2) implement a queue class by inheriting the linked list class (see class interface for the template version attached attached, write a string version as well)

3) implement a singly linked list that inherits the linked list class and it is capable of inserting elements in ascending order in the list.
